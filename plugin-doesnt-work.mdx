## Remove any recently installed plugin

Try to remove the new plugin, restore from a server backup, or downgrade the updated plugin/server version and check if the issue persists.

## Update all dependencies

Update all dependencies, sometimes outdated JARs can cause issues.

## Follow the resourcepack troubleshooting tutorial

## Ask on Discord

Someone might have the same issue. Try also to use the search button.

## **Report the bug if you still have issues**


<Warning>
Use the search button before submitting a report, people might already have reported it.
</Warning>


When you report something be sure to:

* follow every single step of my tutorials and make sure to read all the wiki.&#x20;
* test the plugin on a **CLEAN** server (with only **ItemsAdder** installed) since it could be a plugin interfering.
* use the latest version of the plugin, its dependencies and server.

If the problem persists, and you think it's a bug, send me these information when you report the problem:

* Exactly what you did to trigger the problem
* Server version, use `/version` command and send me the exact text it shows (use it in console to copy and paste)
* Plugin version
* Tell me if you edited the `.yml` files of ItemsAdder
* Tell me if you edited the resourcepack
* Zip ItemsAdder `.yml` files and send me them
* Specify if the plugin shows error in console or in chat
* Complete log of your server (not just a small portion of the error you see of **ItemsAdder** or I can't identify the issue)
