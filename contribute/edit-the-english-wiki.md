<Warning>
## Important notes

* Do not remove the `#` special characters, edit only the next text, these are titles.
* Do not remove or edit special texts inside `{ }`, for example `{% hint style="info" %}`, these are used to create the hint message boxes.
* Do not remove `*` character, these are used to create lists
* Do not remove emojis
* Do not edit or remove the `--- description: ---` text on top of some pages, edit only the inner text.
* Do not remove `\` on some lines end
</Warning>

<Note>
Would be good if you update your repository each time the main repository (the one in English) gets edited, to reflect changes.

To sync it you have to press **Fetch Upstream**.\
