<Note>
You shouldn't have any default asset if you didn't follow the optional steps of the [first install](/plugin-usage/first-install) tutorial.
</Note>


Follow this tutorial to keep you only your own items, blocks and other things without any of the ItemsAdder content.

## How to remove default assets

Open `plugins/ItemsAdder/contents/` folder and delete the folders/files you don't need

Run this command: `/iacleancache items`.

Then run `/iazip`.

## Remove internal assets (not recommended)

If you want to COMPLETELY remove any already provided asset you have to disable this setting.


```yaml config.yml lines icon="yaml"
extract_internal_utility_assets: true
```


Open `plugins/ItemsAdder/contents/` folder and delete the folders/files you don't need.

Then run `/iazip`.


<Warning>
Do not report visual bugs if you delete internal ItemsAdder assets, some are used by the plugin to show GUIs and other things.
</Warning>
