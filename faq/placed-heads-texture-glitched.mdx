<Note>
This bug is less frequent on ItemsAdder 4.0.10 and greater. Consider updating!
</Note>



<Note>
This is caused by the emotes feature of ItemsAdder and currently there is no fix other than disabling them.
</Note>


This bug happens if you have more than 1 player head of the same player in front of you.\
This doesn't happen if you have different player heads in front of you or if you have only 1 head in front of you.

## How to fix

The only way to fix this is to disable emotes system in `config.yml` of **ItemsAdder**.\
Don't forget to regenerate the resourcepack using `/iazip`.
