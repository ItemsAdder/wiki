## Glow outline is strange on players when they wear armor

### This is a known issue

There is no fix for this, it probably is a limitation of the custom armors method.\
Anyway this is a minor graphical issue, I doubt anyone on your server will suffer from it.

To fix that you have to disable the custom armors shader in `config.yml`. You can do it if you do not use them.
