## Remove the resourcepack when the player changes server

Follow this tutorial if you have multiple servers and you want the ItemsAdder resourcepack to be removed when a user switches server.

### How to

1. Download the [blank resourcepack](http://matteodev.it/spigot/itemsadder/blank_pack.zip).
2. Upload it somewhere, for example (skip the `/iazip` part of the tutorial) [DropBox](/../plugin-usage/resourcepack-hosting/resourcepack-on-dropbox), [OneDrive](/../plugin-usage/resourcepack-hosting/onedrive), [GoogleDrive](/../plugin-usage/resourcepack-hosting/google-drive), etc.
3. Get the URL
4. Open the other server `server.properties` file and set the URL


```properties server.properties lines icon="properties"
resource-pack=http://your_url/blank_pack.zip
```


Done!

The ItemsAdder resourcepack will be replaced by the default resourcepack when the player joins your other server.
