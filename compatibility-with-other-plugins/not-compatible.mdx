_**Is it compatible with plugin X?**_

I can't answer surely to this question because I can't know how every plugin in the world is coded, but here is a list of plugins that can cause problems:

* All plugins that uses **custom resourcepacks** (you can make them compatible if you've a minimum knowledge on how to merge resourcepacks manually, be sure to not replace ItemsAdder files and you're done)
<Card title="CraftEnhance" icon="download" href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/custom-recipes-and-crafting-craftenhance.65058/" horizontal></Card>, this plugin messes up ItemsAdder custom recipes logic and creates duplication bugs. So please don't use it
* Plugins that customize crafting table behaviour and recipes
<Card title="LootChest " icon="download" href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lootchest.61564/" horizontal></Card>can cause some [problems](https://github.com/LoneDev6/ItemsAdder/issues/15#issuecomment-512990849)
* For now it's **not compatible** with **plugins** and world generators that **spawn mushroom** blocks with different faces to create custom textures. In the future I will add compatibility.
