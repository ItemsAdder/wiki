# Space

## [Download here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/space.59572/)

## Adding compatibility


<Warning>
Update ItemsAdder to 3.3.0+
</Warning>


Create a new folder: `ItemsAdder/contents/space/resourcepack/`

Extract the Space plugin resourcepack in the previous folder so that you have something like that:\
`ItemsAdder/contents/space/resourcepack/assets/...`

Then run `/iazip` and follow the [hosting tutorial](../../plugin-usage/resourcepack-hosting/).

## Known issues

### Particles problems

After you've merged the resourcepacks you will notice double particles from blocks.\
This is normal and I can't fix it for now, it's because of how Space plugin creases blocks models (in the wrong way).
