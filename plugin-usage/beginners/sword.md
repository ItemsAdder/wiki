# My First Sword


<Warning>
### **Resourcepack hosting**

Remember to **decide** a [**resourcepack hosting**](../resourcepack-hosting/) method **before** you **start**.\
I **advise** you to use **self-host** which is **easier** and **faster**, but you can also use **Dropbox** and similar
</Warning>


## Creating the swords file config


<Warning>
This is an example sword (remember to change `my_items` namespace to the one you want).
</Warning>


For example I created a **file** which will contain all my **custom swords**:\
`contents/my_items/configs/myswords.yml`

In this file (`myswords.yml`) I start creating a simple sword called `mysword`


```yaml contents/my_items/configs/myswords.yml lines icon="yaml"
info:
  namespace: my_items
items:
  mysword:
    display_name: My Sword
    permission: myitems.mysword
    durability:
      max_custom_durability: 1324
```


## Item texture

### Creating the texture file

Now the fun part, let's set the sword texture.\
To do that you have to put your sword `.png` texture file inside the correct folder.

In this case your **namespace** is `my_items` so you have to put it here:

`contents/my_items/textures/item/mysword.png`

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image_\(14\).png)

### Applying the texture file to your item

Now open `myswords.yml` file again and add the `resource` part as I did.\
As you can see I set `generate: true` and I set the textures for the item.\
This tells the plugin to generate the 3D model automatically using your texture.


```yaml contents/my_items/configs/myswords.yml lines icon="yaml"
info:
  namespace: myitems
items:
  mysword:
    name: My Sword
    permission: myitems.mysword
    resource:
      material: DIAMOND_SWORD
      generate: true
      texture: item/example_item.png
    durability:
      max_custom_durability: 1324
```


## Final part

Now you just need to tell the plugin to load your just added item.\
To do that you have to:

* &#x20;join the server
* &#x20;make sure you accepted the resourcepacks
* &#x20;use the command `/iazip`
* (if you're using **external-host** (**DropBox**) scroll down and follow the instructions)
* &#x20;get the item using `/iaget mysword`
