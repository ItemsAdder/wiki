# Good Resourcepack Tips

## Maintaining custom content


<Warning>
You shouldn't edit my custom example items, as in the future I might update them and you'll go crazy maintaining both your customization and my updates.

It's advised to create your own items instead.
</Warning>


## Assets style

Don't forget that this is a pixelated game not an ultra HD AAA game.\
You don't need HD textures nor very detailed 3D models filled with cubes.

## Sounds size

Don't forget to compress your sounds. Do not put big music and sound effects files in your pack. This will make the pack slow to download. Consider compressing your packs using some tools.
