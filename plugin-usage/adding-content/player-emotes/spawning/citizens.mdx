## Animating a player Citizens NPC

Finally you can animate any Citizens player NPC!


<Note>
This plugin doesn't require Citizens to work, but some servers might need to use it to create NPCs.
</Note>


### Make the NPC animatable and change skin

Then change the skin using the **ItemsAdder** command:\
`/iaentity citizens playerskin <playerName|skinUrl>`\
Examples:

* `/iaentity citizens playerskin LoneDev`
* `/iaentity citizens playerskin` [`https://minesk.in/8b4bf861ea544edd8529707276d24853`](https://minesk.in/8b4bf861ea544edd8529707276d24853)

### Optional: getting/uploading custom skins
