## Animating a player Citizens NPC

Finally you can animate any Citizens player NPC!


<Note>
This plugin doesn't require Citizens to work, but some servers might need to use it to create NPCs.
</Note>


### Make the NPC animatable and change skin

Then change the skin using the **ItemsAdder** command:\
`/iaentity citizens playerskin <playerName|skinUrl>`\
Examples:

* `/iaentity citizens playerskin LoneDev`
* `/iaentity citizens playerskin` [`https://minesk.in/8b4bf861ea544edd8529707276d24853`](https://minesk.in/8b4bf861ea544edd8529707276d24853)

### Optional: getting/uploading custom skins


<Card title="Broken link" icon="text" href="/broken-reference/" horizontal>
Broken link
</Card>


### Make head rotate

You can make the NPC look at nearby players by using this command, more info on [Citizens wiki](https://wiki.citizensnpcs.co/Commands).\
`/npc look`

### Done
