You can animate your models normally, like you would do with normal Blockbench models.\
You can find a lot of tutorials on YouTube.

You can specify if the player can move while playing one specific animation or not.

## Looping animations

You can create animations which would play `start` -> `loop` -> `end` sub-animation.\
This allows you to create complex looping animations, for example a sleep animation where your player would lay and stay there until the player presses SHIFT.

### Step 1

Create the animation, in this example a death animation.

Right click it and mark it as `Loop`.

### Step 2

Now place the cursor on the frame where you want the loop to start, in this case when the player is on the ground.

### Step 3

Click on the `Add Loop Start/End marker` icon to add a `start loop` marker.

Now place the animation cursor on the frame where you want the loop to stop and press again on the `Add Loop Start/End marker` icon.

The result will be like this:
