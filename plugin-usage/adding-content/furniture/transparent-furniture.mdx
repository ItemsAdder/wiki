<Warning>
If you want to make some transparent or semi-transparent textures you have to make sure you based your item on a vanilla item that accepts transparency.\
For example **`WHITE_STAINED_GLASS`**
</Warning>


### Example

```yaml
resource:
  material: WHITE_STAINED_GLASS
  generate: false
  model_path: item/your_model
```
