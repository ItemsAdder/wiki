<details>

<summary>v3 limitations</summary>

* Head bone rotation works only if the mob head is not too far from the center of the body
* Pressing SHIFT on flying mobs to move down works only on 1.15, 1.17 and 1.18 clients as 1.16 clients have this bug: [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-202202](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-202202) .\
  1.16 clients will see players flying if they press SHIFT while on a flying entity while they should still be riding the entity.
* This plugin uses multiple entities to create the animation. \
  Network delay can cause slight animation glitches. \
  It can cause a little lag on servers if you spawn too many entities around players and if your models have too many bones.\
  (NOTE: this plugin is highly optimized so you won't get lag if your server is not a potato)
