To use the status textures, you need to add suffixes to your model filename or texture.

If you plan to use textures (png) you have to set `generate: true`.\
If you plan to use models (json) you have to set `generate: false`, as you already have the models.&#x20;

* `_0` - First pulling state.
* `_1` - Second pulling state.
* `_2` - Third pulling state.
* `_charged` - A charged crossbow with an arrow.
* `_firework` - A charged crossbow with a firework.

## Adding item states using suffixes

Refer to the bow tutorial, just add the missing image files.
