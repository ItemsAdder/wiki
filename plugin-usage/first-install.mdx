</Warning>


Before using the plugin you have to decide the resourcepack hosting method.\
Read [this tutorial](resourcepack-hosting/) to decide the hosting method for the resourcepack (best method: `self-host`).

***

## Step 3 - (optional) Add official ItemsAdder custom content

**ItemsAdder** comes with a lot of custom content already created for you.\
It's not automatically included in the downloaded plugin because some people might not want every item/feature automatically added into their server.

### Download the ["Default pack" here](https://github.com/ItemsAdder/DefaultPack/releases/latest)

<div align="left"><img src="/assets/images/image (63).png" alt="" /></div>

* Extract the content into the `ItemsAdder` folder and overwrite the files if asked.
* Run the `/iazip` command.
* Follow your [hosting method](resourcepack-hosting/) if you're not using **self-host**.

## Step 4 - (optional) Add other ItemsAdder custom content

### Download ["Other pack" here](https://github.com/ItemsAdder/OtherPacks/releases/latest)
