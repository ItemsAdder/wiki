# Loading screen

## Customization of the loading screen

You can use this tool to create a custom loading screen: [https://non0reo.github.io/ImgToShader/](https://non0reo.github.io/ImgToShader/)


<Warning>
For now it doesn't allow inserting custom logo but only changing colors and hiding the Mojang logo.
</Warning>
